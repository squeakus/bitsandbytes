Matthew, any chance you're interesting in releasing the source for this? It's absolutely fantastic, and I let it run for hours... now I want to play with it more, and I'm wondering what the code looks like.

What selection method does he use? Roulette wheel? What are the mutation rates? Does he use "throwback" techniques when previous generations had a better fit than the current one (apparently not)?

that's what they should teach in schools when talking about evolution.

Not about wether or not your cousin waldo resembles more or less an ape, not either jesus met dinossaurs, not about fossils or all that hard biology.

They should teach about evolution the universal law, the universal process, the 'algorithm' (maybe not saying that a-word) and how it can be universally applied to anything.

That's when evolution stops being something abstract that may have happened billions of years ago and may or may not contradict you beliefs, and evolution becomes a useful everyday tool.

"that nudge" is usually supplied by your dumber neighbors being eaten or eating the wrong kind of food, themselves.

My G-d created a marvelous Universe that runs itself just fine from His first principles -- and He doesn't need to constantly tinker with it. I'm so sorry to hear that yours in still in Beta. "Intelligent Design" is not -- it's an apologia for Flawed Creation from a minor deity.

yay! well done! i was looking for something like this to explain GA to a n00b friend of mine.

the only tweak i would make would be to display the top one or two designs. that way you could see what design the current one was competing against.

and for the person who commented about the app's inefficiency.. i think the main purpose for this app is to demonstrate GA in general, not to be the most efficient at what it's doing.

@#9 Alexandre Van de Sande
Exactly!
And what would even drive the point home even further, would to have the failed car generations remain stuck in piles of wasted iterations.
Slowly zoom out to reveal the many, many broken versions in comparison to the few successes. Evolution doesn't have end goals-- there's results based on the functional survival of mutations. Giraffes didn't grow longer necks from straining to reach the top leaves, the descendants of mutants that had longer necks were simply eating more, living longer, and procreating more often.
Interactive mediums and animated illustrations seem to be the best tools toward explaining such an abstract concept, including the many thousands of years abbreviated to a human scale.
I wish there were these kind of examples and COSMOS type programs in development-- this type of "layman explanation" is just what the world needs to increase scientific literacy.

                  After enough time, all of my cars start to look the same.

                  Long-ish wheel base with medium or larger wheels (usually similarly sized). The masses (red circles) are suspended near the mid point just high enough to clear the terrain. The supporting springs tend to be soft.

                  The most common failure mode (aside from mutation related funkyness) involves a red circle moving too low and striking the ground after a large bump. With the right combination of springs and weights sometimes a series of bumps can completely invert the Explorer... just like real life.

                        It seems the cars are given too little time on the track, creating many diverse but ok designs. More time on track would probably narrow it down a little.

            Oh, the disappointment. I've been running mine for quite a while when suddenly it grows a fucking huge front wheel. The previous thousand "cars" keep failing on this particularly large drop and I suspect the big wheel will give this species an advantage. At the very least, it's the right direction.

            I watch, almost in tears, as the vehicle flips, dooming its passengers to a pointy upside-down death.

                        That's hardly a wheel. When I roll along the ground independant of anything else, I'm hardly 'freewheeling', I'm rolling along the smegging ground.

                              According to Wikipedia a wheel is "a circular device that is capable of rotating on its axis, facilitating movement or transportation whilst supporting a load, or performing labour" So I guess rolling on the floor isn't enough to be called a wheel.

      suggestions:

            better statistics. identify what the longest distance achieved was, and distribute each of the individuals along a bell curve.
         2.

            MULTIPLAYER, BABY! Our little cars could have sex with / fight each other.
         3.

            I would say 'extend the time limit' but thats just my greater issues with the concept of death speaking out. Maybe include the ability to modify what the different constraints are.
         4.

            Cross-generational analysis. Show what % of each generation achieved the goals of the previous generations. Show how many individuals 'aborted' (i.e. instant death or -50% achievement of mean) per generation -- does overspecialization cause higher abortion/miscarriage rate?
         5.

            More evolutionary barriers. Throw in some pits that they have to have enough speed to jump over, that kind of thing.

                  LOWER THE MUTATION RATE... Good heavens, a population of 20 that regularly makes it past the crater is often breeding a second generation where as many as 1/3 of the descendants fail to even make the first hill.
               2.

                  Elitist selection. I've had one of these simulations running for 8 hours and the "best" design fails to increase monotonically because it isn't making it into the next generation.
               3.

                  Use Gray Codes. There appears to be a hamming cliff in the case of a triangular-shaped car with roughly centered weights. The approximately-quadrilateral car beats it every time and the triangular car can't evolve into a quadrilateral. I'm not sure why, but it looks like it might be a cliff.

                              At first, I was thinking, start the line as a straight line, and evolve the car for twenty rounds. Then evolve the line to try to minimize(crash it!) the cars movements. I'm thinking model the line as a large series of connected points that can 'evolve' up or down.

                              Here is the trick: you'd have to also reward line smoothness or it would make a wall.

                                    Line Rider is awesome because the path LOOKS like something. I'd evolve a line rider path which looked as much like an edge of a picture as possible while allowing the sled maximal distance along mostly unique lines.

                                          You are assuming the car can only go forward. Give the car some initial force, and count any distance traveled as legit. Even if it goes up a steep hill, it will have to come down that steep hill.

                                          Although, the metric would have to change to movement, as opposed to distance from the initial place.

                                          You could do the picture thing too, but then they'd be cooperative... It occurs to me you could evolve them together in such a case, which would likely simplify the problem.

      Wonderful! I picked this link up from a comment in another article last night and have been running six simulations side by side all morning. In fact I was just comparing the six continuously improving vehicles right before I switched to reddit and read the title. :)

      The vehicles seem to do best when their weight, suspension, and wheel spacing are optimum for getting over the big crater. Also, it seems that a few designs find unique local maxima, where they oscillate, never finding the global maximum that most of settle on.

      Finally, I have a hunch if one were to take the spatial fourier transform of the terrain, that the optimum wheel spacing would be d/2 where d corresponds to the largest spectral peak. That is, the wheels tend to be sized to just straddle the predominant peaks.

            "The vehicles seem to do best when their weight, suspension, and wheel spacing are optimum for getting over the big crater."

            Makes sense - the peak is the biggest immediate barrier, therefore it will have the most predominate effect on the construction of the vehicle. That's the way it is when you engineer something, too.

                        I remember doing it in XP a few years back. I tried making a flash desktop that would launch my programs and do animations and things. I dont think you can point directly at the swf file, but if you embed it in an html page you can use Active Desktop to display it.

                        Looks like Active Desktop was discontinued for Vista. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Desktop

            One of my windows got stuck in a "W strategy" for a while: It realized that, if you start high enough, a controlled collapse can actually get you pretty far. There were generations of front-heavy cars after that, with the red circles poised to lean over and grab a little more length at the end of the run.

            I've seen this in other genetic algorithm work. I guess it's hard to distinguish diving from sustainable locomotion.

                  Yeah, mine is definitely surmounting hills by tipping over them.

                  The basic template is a right triangle. The left wheel is large, the right wheel small. Above the small wheel is a large weight, and exactly halfway along the line between the large wheel and large weight is a very small weight.

                  As it lurches onto a hill (or even a small bump), it starts to tip over. The large wheel and large weight counterbalance, so it skates along on one wheel. On the other side of the small hills, it then rights itself and continues along.

                  This works until it encounters the large downward slope and flips over to its doom.

                  -edit-

                  It's now tweaked the parameters such that it almost always gets past the previous point of doom. No viable competitors have emerged, and the triangle car is slowly optimizing for speed.

      I'm not very big on the current crop of genetic algorithms. It seems like we're doing the whole inheritance thing wrong. The demos I've seen to date all get stuck in local minima or jump all over the solution space and this one is no different. I think there is more to evolution than we currently account for in our computer modeling. For example, there might be environmental effects on the DNA of the parents that get propagated to offspring. Thus evolution might be a sum of not just inheritance and random variation but also the experience of the parents. Granted this is a controversial hypothesis but it's something many evolutionary biologists are beginning to warm up to.

      Secondly, most genetic algorithms that I see popping around the net do not implement speciation and allow species with too much genetic diversity to crossbreed resulting in pretty pathetic offspring. This is evident in this simulation as well where two passable designs often get crossbred producing an utterly useless vehicle.

      Finally, remember that evolution is nothing more than a stochastic search of the solution space that may or may not get stuck in a local minimum. There is nothing magical about it. The reason it produces such impressive variety of species on this planet is that the computation was executed with immense parallelism for almost four billion years. And it still had a tendency to get stuck in local minima. Consider the pre-cambrian explosion period or the reign of dinosaurs. I think there are more interesting stochastic search algorithms that produce equally interesting results.

      But it's a cool animation nonetheless. It seems to be heavily constrained in its gene expression though as I'd expect it to be able to come upon a big front wheel pretty quickly yet it keeps stuck in the same pattern and really not making progress. Is the mating system properly designed? It seems like the subsequent generations have too much variation so the good traits often get lost. I think there you're allowing for too much random mutation and not enough inheritance...

      I watched it for a while and it really isn't a great example of a genetic algorithm. After weeding out the designs that fail immediately none of the designs did a whole lot better than any others. It's not really that it converged as there was still a great deal of variety in the cars, but their performance did not vary greatly, which kills the effectiveness of a genetic algorithm. A better track which creates more variation in fitness might make for more interesting results.

            I'm not completely sure, but I think the "great variety" of cars is due to either a bad selection algorithm or a high mutation rate. I suspect the latter. I've seen runs that had 20/20 cars at least make the first hill, followed by a generation where 5 or 6 (hard to say because they blip by so fast) die immediately.

      This reminds me of some stuff I looked at with sodaplay ( http:/www.sodaplay.com ) and sodarace (http://www.sodarace.com ). (this was all before soda * 2.0 came out, and I think it is completely different now.

      Basically sodaplay was a system of placing springs, muscles and joints. You could then ajust the springiness, gravity, and friction of the environment, and the strength of the muscles. The muscles went through a phase, of speed which you could determine, and you could place the muscles at different points in the oscillation so they could be timed differently. All the muscles contracted based on a sine wave, I believe.

      That was sodaplay, but sodarace was a thing where people competed creating these things to move the fastest on different terrain. People could create their own models, but also there was some stuff to use computers to help, as the designs could be saved to xml.

      Some people at an English university (queen mary or something) wrote a program to do simulated annealing on an ameoba (a rolling thing), and made it extremely fast.

      There was also a program called miro which would do that for any model you gave it, and wodka which would randomly generate models, and truly "evolve" models using breeding etc, but mostly they were vibrating masses.

      The speedup by running a model through a computer optimizer like that made a ridiculous improvement in speed.

      Note: here is wodka: http://wodka.sourceforge.net/

      I always have difficulty finding miro, because there are other things with the same name. The guy who wrote it also wrote an improved sodarace runner, which removed some of the physics limits and made the races more fair be eliminating starting velocities.

      That was how I found out about genetic algorithms. I think it was really cool, and something people at reddit would like. I don't really know what is up with sodaplay 2, but someone who has checked it out could tell me.

This is a GA I wrote to design a little car for a specific terrain. It runs in real-time in Flash.

The fitness function is the distance travelled before the red circles hit the ground, or time runs out. The degrees of freedom are the size and inital positions of the four circles, and length, spring constant and damping of the eight springs. The graph shows the "mean" and "best" fitness.

I should really make a new version with better explanations of what's going on.

edit: thanks very much for all the nice comments! i'll try and find some time to make a more polished version where you can fiddle with the parameters, create maps etc.

Are you familiar with Hod Lipson's work? He does a lot of the same things at Cornell.

Extraordinarily cool.

Edit

A few cool anecdotes from Lipson's talk:

1) One of his robots evolved to be extremely tall and just fall over after it was created. The way fitness was scored, this counted as going an extremely long horizontal distance, so it was highly favored.

2) Another robot found an error in their physics code and learned how to fly in their simulations.

3) Another one started vibrating really fast, generated a divide by zero error, and thus got infinite fitness because it "traveled" infinitely far.

Damn, that is impressive. I spent way to long watching it.

Two important points stand out immediately to me.

   1.

      It hits "barriers". The first one is staying on flat ground, the second one is hitting the first hill, third one is getting up a steep incline and the third one (and where I gave up after quite a while) is not toppling over itself when it goes down that crater. I imagine natural evolution is much the same, hitting barriers that confine the expansion of a species until suddenly there is some important mutation that overcomes the barrier.
   2.

      Evolution is S.T.U.P.I.D. One keeps thinking "no, no, the center of gravity has to be more to the back..", but still it produces car after car putting the weight at the front because it has no understanding whatsoever. This is what I think what makes evolution hard to understand for many people, we are so apt to think and reason about things, while evolution is quite simply just the brute force method of try, try again.

My hat tips to you!

Right you are!

"Originally applied by Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology of 1864, Spencer drew parallels to his ideas of economics with Charles Darwin's theories of evolution by what Darwin termed natural selection.

Although Darwin used the phrase "survival of the fittest" as a synonym for "natural selection",[1] it is a metaphor, not a scientific description.[2] It is not generally used by modern biologists, who use the phrase "natural selection" almost exclusively."

Ridiculous as it seems now, at the time "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation" was published anonymously in 1844 it was thought that every species was of a fixed type created by a god with no transmutation from one to another. Wallace wrote very many years later to Darwin "On the Tendency of Varieties to depart from the Original Type".

Individuals, even well-adapted individuals die but the trend is that variants best fitted to their circumstances survive.

Huh? I don't see how that makes him right. The article seems to directly contradict the GP:

    "I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient."

OK, I guess, but I took your post to mean that Darwin somehow disapproved of the term or wasn't familiar with it. He was in fact aware of the term and explicitly approved of it, calling it "more accurate" than natural selection.

I suppose I could take your post to mean you were stressing the difference between "evolution" and "natural selection", but that seems like a really odd way to do it.

Another aspect that people miss, and especially the creationists seem to be unaware of is the tallest midget. When you make competitive evolving systems it's amazing how BAD your simulated organisms can be and still thrive. Bad at steering, bad at eating, bad at mating. They don't need to be good, just marginally better than their competition.

"Life doesn't work perfectly, it just works." - My evolutionary bio professor.

It gets deeper though. Evolution works in search spaces that can basically be considered infinite-dimensional and where there is no known method for calculating an optimum. We have no way of knowing how "good" an evolved solution is in such a space relative to a theoretical global maximum, since the global maximum is impossible to ever find.

For example, the human genome has about 3 billion base pairs. Each base can have four values. Therefore, we have a search space of 3 billion dimensions with 4^3000000000 possible unique combinations. There might be super-beings with X-ray vision, telepathy, million year life spans, and the ability to levitate in there, but we can't prove it or find them.

There are fewer meaningfully unique permutations than that as the triplets can only code for one of twenty amino acids vs 81 combinations of base pairs in a codon.

As for super-powers- other than the million year life span which is just not useful as far as evolution is concerned so may be achievable, any of those abilities would have dominated the natural environment so I'd feel comfortable concluding they're not in there.

What lies ahead will be directed and technological. We're talking about the options available to genes. Superpowers are not going to evolve. Levitation has already been done, it's called flight and you can see how dedicated to producing that evolution had to be. Mindreading would require long-term evolution among animals with minds worth reading which isn't going to happen as technology happens so much faster, we'll build wearable mind reading devices before evolution could produce it.

As soon as the population achieves a certain level of sustainability, and every degenerate lowlife (literally) can sustain it's life, the really unique solutions that have a greater advantage over the others aren't stimulated anymore (don't have an advantage over the others) and thus will be bread out due to the shear numbers of the genetic waste that can procreate itself until the whole ecosystem dies off... pretty much whats happening to earth right now :)

Yes. The classic example are our own eyes. Our retina is in fact turned inside out - with light receptor cells facing inwards and all the veins and nerves stacked on the inside, so light has to pass those to get to the receptors.

I've started this thing over many times and it seems the center of gravity ends up in the front every single time, without fail. I think the issue here is that the beginnings of the course demand it. The car is being designed to travel as far across the course in 5 seconds as possible, and nothing else. The program would be much more effective if the terrain was randomly generated for every iteration. It may take slightly longer to come up with a good solution, but I think the car created would be a much better "real world" example.

That said, the program is awesome.

Then you're optimizing for cars that have the best chance of dealing with some random piece of terrain. That's a different problem. This program is optimizing for the car that traverses this particular terrain best.

I agree with adremeaux, I don't care about a car that is optimized for that specific, particular terrain. I'd much rather see a car that is optimized for random terrains. It just seems so much more intuitive and somehow more useful, even as an intellectual exercise that way.

Also, I look forward to a future version with tweakable parameters for all of the variables!

    I agree with adremeaux, I don't care about a car that is optimized for that specific, particular terrain.

I was mostly just responding to adremeaux's wording. He said, "The program would be much more effective if the terrain was randomly generated for every iteration." When I first read that, it sounded to me like "a better way to implement the same thing is...". So I was just trying to highlight that it's a different goal, not just a different implementation.

Having said that, it seems to me it's a more complex and more difficult thing to implement this if you are changing the course every time. You are then, effectively, changing the fitness function constantly. Certain traits that were rewarded in the previous generation will be punished in the current generation. Maybe the current course requires very little ability to go over sharp bumps without bottoming out (which would reward a shorter wheelbase) but the previous course rewarded the ability to stay balanced (not tip over) on a steep incline (which would reward a longer wheelbase). In the face of changing challenges, you'd want relatively few mutations to ensure that traits that are needed only occasionally are still preserved. Otherwise, you run the risk of over-fitting (is that the right term) to the short term problems and never arriving at a solution that's good over a variety of problems in the long term.

So AFAICT, randomizing the course requires more carefully tuned parameters, which makes it a harder programming problem.

Isn't that what happens in the real world? Organisms don't evolve in a static environment. For one thing, there are a lot of competing organisms around them. One species' adaptation can cause negative consequences for another.

I'd like to see the road be subject to a genetic algorithm, where its fitness function is defined by how well it retards the vehicles. It'd be like predator/prey evolution in action.

It'd probably be overdoing it to randomly generate a completely new terrain for every generation of the vehicle. The real world doesn't change that drastically that often. It'd be interesting to randomize the terrain, say, every 50 car generations. Or simply allow the terrain to evolve slightly each time - that incline a bit steeper, that crevice a bit shallower, etc.

Perhaps even better would be to run two populations at once: a population of cars whose fitness is how far they get and a population of courses whose fitness is determined by how quickly they dispatch the cars. Then you can get the red-queen effect working for you. This is, of course, assuming you want to actually evolve cars that can deal with arbitrary terrain, not just one specific course.

The center of gravity being relatively far forward is also useful when going down the jump where many "creatures" tend to flip over and fall on their head. And the time limit seems more like 7 seconds.

Not to mention its adaptive value very, very early on, when nothing can survive the initial fall. Falling forward gives a huge marginal advantage over falling straight down.

hmmm... not quite true. at first yes, but just as it is rather uncommon for human babies to be born with tusks, over time, this simulation rarely produces cars with poor centre of gravity (for the course it faces). Evolution is random but also convergent on success.

The point is not if it is true, but that to me (a human) it looks sensible to move the center of mass backwards as the car keeps toppling over itself -- the point is that evolution does not "design" with forward thinking like this.

This is the most common misconception that I encounter with people's understanding of evolution, e.g. animals needed fangs so they evolved with fangs.

I've heard it made as an evolutional argument that since people (and I'm focusing on the western world here) generally benefit from not having wisdom teeth, by evolution more and more people are born without them.

Did you know your brain spends more time with inhibitory neural signals than with excitatory signals? You spend more neural energy winnowing down than building up. I've speculated for a long time that our brains might be doing something like an evolutionary process, at least to some extent. (In reality our brains are probably hybrid systems using a bunch of overlaid techniques that worked for our ancestors in different ways, but evolutionary-computational ones might be in there.)

Not exactly. Our brains are very slow, by silicon processor standards, but intensely parallel. Genetic algorithms can make use of parallelism, but they are not the best application of it. In any case, implementing a massively parallelized genetic algorithm on a neural network would be a laughably inefficient use of the hardware.

Yes it is stupid, in the sense that the weight isn't moved back or lower because it will work well. It only looks "intelligent" because if you repeat natural selection for an ridiculous number of times, the better design will emerge.

Our brains only look intelligent because if you fire 100 billion neurons for a while a better design will emerge.

BTW, for the non-biologists in the house, a neuron is not just a switch that can be modeled with an equation. It's a living cell with millions of internal components and a gene regulatory network that itself resembles a brain-like regulatory network when its interactions are graphed.

Gene regulatory networks look like this, for example:

http://www.pnas.org/content/104/31/12890/F2.large.jpg

Oh, and there are about ten glial cells in the brain for every one neuron and it appears based on recent research that those participate to some extent in computation and learning as well:

I think what I'm getting at here is what does it mean for something to be "stupid" vs. "intelligent."

Is our intelligence just a matter of massive computational throughput? The answer is "we don't know." We don't really know enough to give a definitive answer.

I suspect that the brain is a mixture of both: that we have a general learning capability that just crunches a lot of stuff to learn in general situations, but that we also have a number of very clever "hacks" in there that give us shortcuts to learning in certain kinds of solution spaces... namely those that were valuable for our ancestors. However, those hacks may be the origins of some of our blind spots (see my other post on the No Free Lunch Theorem). For example, why are we so unspeakably awful at estimating statistical risk? Why do we fall for confirmation bias so often, or see Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich? Maybe some of our hacks work against us in other domains.

My overarching point is that you can't say that evolution is "stupid" without making an apples to apples comparison. The question is a lot more nuanced than that.

No, our brains genuinely are intelligent. They don't learn, as you are perhaps implying, through some kind of super-back-propagation algorithm, or anything else directly analogous to evolution. In fact some learning algorithms are built-in to the brain by evolution [citation needed? Perhaps Chomsky].

You're right that no-one understands the brain. But Chomsky is still a reasonable citation for the claim that evolution builds some learning algorithms into the brain.

But even if we don't know how exactly the brain does work, we do know that it's not directly analogous to evolution. The brain is capable of directed learning (whether by example or by reasoning).

If you take Hecht-Nielsen's theory of cognition, we think by running a series of confabulations against past experience until only one survives.

In that sense, these are both the same sort of intelligence, since no actual cars are harmed in the working-out of the algorithm. Your brain sees a car working poorly, and imagines what would happen in a number of related scenarios. It's running gedankenexperiments just like the little Flash app, otherwise it wouldn't be able to make predictions at all...only it's doing so invisibly and much more efficiently.

Hecht-Nielsen could be wrong, of course...

You are not getting the point. I'm comparing people's common misunderstanding of evolution and trying to explain how it really is. When I say "stupid" I mean stupid in the common sense.

You may call this algorithm intelligent if you like, but real evolution does not compare any series against any past - there is just a population with some gene pool, and some genes are more likely to survive than others. Period.

The human brain works totally different from von Neumann style computers. It's very slow neuron-wise but extremely parallelized. That's why you can't compute things in your mind any PC computes in a millisecond.

For some things (like consciousness?) the parallel brain architecture is much better suited, and simulating this architecture on a von-Neumann machine requires incredible amounts of computing power.

That antenna optimization problem sounds like a problem that's tailor-made for genetic algorithms.

Note that they're not, as far as I know, actually coming up with a new antenna design. They're choosing (near-)optimal parameters for a design that already exists: for example, the computer starts with something like the assumption that the antenna will have N parallel elements, and it is just trying to find the best value of N (or maybe that's a given), and the lengths and spacing.

"I've never seen a "true" genetic algorithm that is competitive with engineered algorithms. You can start with a sub-optimal solution for a control problem and optimize it by some kind of evolution, I've seen that work pretty well for neural nets."

You're right, but you're sort of missing the point.

There is a theorem in machine learning theory called the "No Free Lunch Theorem." It's a bit hard to get your head around, but what it basically says is that all learning algorithms perform equally when averaged over the set of all possible search spaces.

This means that any time you tweak an algorithm to be better in search spaces with certain characteristics, you're making it worse in other situations.

The goal of evolutionary algorithms is typically good general performance across the board, which means that they will usually be worse than engineered algorithms designed for specific situations. But here's the point: compute cycles are orders of magnitude cheaper than human cycles. The goal is to allow computers to learn in a variety of problem spaces automatically without human intervention or specialized a priori knowledge. For that, not only does evolution work, but I actually know of no other approach that does this at all. Evolutionary processes are the only thing that I've ever seen that can make a computer invent something "ex nihilo."

Finally, on the subject of the brain's processing power, you basically agreed with me:

"For some things (like consciousness?) the parallel brain architecture is much better suited, and simulating this architecture on a von-Neumann machine requires incredible amounts of computing power."

It's true that the brain's serial "clock speed" is nowhere close to even very early computers. However, the total throughput is significantly larger. We don't even know how much larger yet since we haven't discovered all the ways the brain computes, but based on what we do know we know it's orders of magnitude beyond present-day computers.

    I've speculated for a long time that our brains might be doing something like an evolutionary process, at least to some extent.

At least that's how it forms during infancy and childhood--IIRC infants are born with ca. 3x the amount of neurons in an adult brain, and a "mini-evolution" routine during development cuts the connections and cells that aren't very effective. That's why it's so important to provide a child with stimulation and allow him to experiment.

Very, very cool! My humble suggestion: make it into a proper Spore...

   1.

      Make some serialized text representation of the vehicle, that it prints out into a text field, where we can cut n paste. Allow us to paste in another text representation as a starting seed.
   2.

      Then - people paste their favourites to this thread!!! Someone else (or many others) continues the evolution, in parallel!!!

Or you could make a subreddit for it etc. A fancier input is to enable it to accept the text-rep in a long REST-style URL - that way we can lazily just click on another version. For now, trust redditors not to reverse engineer the format... that would be practicing intelligent design.

This is an idea I've reserved for a long time - but you can have it, sir, as a finer custodian than me. :-)

EDIT by "a proper Spore", I meant what Spore was aiming at, but didn't achieve. This work of prunesquallor is already more realistic than Spore.

I've been thinking about this for quite a while. Creating a text representation for this simulation would be easy. It would be interesting to create a genome-like string of 0's and 1's and figure out how to construct an object out of those.

The problem is allowing unlimited iterations. Basically, there are a finite number of combination possible in this specific simulation, and you're looking for the most efficient solution. GA's are really good at that. At the same time, you're not going to see things like (to use this example) a third or fourth wheel popping up.

I could really be misunderstanding how this is built, though. My sole exposure to GA comes through a Ruby Programming book that simplified things enough for me to understand it.

Its pretty cool, although it usually cuts the car off before it gets to the end. and many good designs just randomly die.

I think he just limited the time they "live". So the cars that make it that far are still considered the fittest.

and in most cases the red circles hit the ground very soon, so the fitness function filters away things that get stuck or are slow very well (their fitnesses are all after the first steep descents).

We used that book as our unofficial text for an evolutionary computing course at my university (Michigan State). It manages to be both concise and readable, and web searches can usually pick up the slack when you need more detail on specific topics.

What selection algorithm(s) are you using? I thought it odd that a solution that could get past the crater evolved, but didn't make it into the next generation. I assume you don't have elitism enabled?

Is the distance traveled by the furthermost point in the vehicle the measure? Or is the front wheel the measure? Because all of mine eventually flip over at the end, and I wonder if that puts them slightly ahead of those that don't flip over at the end of the five seconds.

In other words, it's bred something that does an impressive wipeout in the last nanosecond of life in order to go just a titch further.

Brute force would be working through every possible iteration one by one. This is very different from brute force.

Wow! That is a nice demonstration of a genetic algorithm. It is so cool to see the variations that fail (especially in the beginning). Usually only the best result of an iteration is shown (like in the article). This would make for a very good demonstration in a class about GA.

Also, is it the case that after iteration 10 not a lot of improvement is seen? All the little carts don't get past the big pit.

You have to really let it run for a while. It will plateau and then climb steeply in efficiency, and then plateau again. I just have it open in a new tab and check in on it every once in a while.

I'm hoping that somebody gets around to making a game based around this idea. Maybe some kind of strategy or puzzle game where you have to evolve units to accomplish specific tasks. You'd have no direct influence over their evolution, except maybe to crossbreed ones with traits you want for certain things.

I'm never going to do it, so somebody should get on this!

The biggest thing I would like to see with this is the ability to let it go longer and see a fitness "score" that tries to objectify how well a particular run did. But then I guess that would only be useful if you could compare generations after the end of the run.

Either way, awesome job and look forward to your revised one when you find the time.

Why the downvotes? They don't improve much after they evolve to make it down the pit safely because they get cut off by the timer. I'd like the see a checkpoint system. Also the source code so I can play with it.

Thanks for this, this is very cool.
I look forward to an updated version with tweakable parameters for all of the variables.
A map creator sounds fun and also perhaps a random map option.
You could turn this into a game or a race, also even eventually I'd love to see a 3D version or game, more of a physics model toy. I can imagine a monster truck 4x4 simulator where you can put together a whole track with obstacles you have to run over or knock down. The designs could be saved as an ASCII text string so people could pit their designs against others and run on a set of test tracks. You could turn this into something way cooler than spore and make $millions! I hope you do, just remember to keep it shareware, maybe have an option to pay $5 to unlock additional features or whatever, no DRM! You can combine this idea with some sort of turret game such as Storm Winds, except you could make the turrets GA optimize with variable parameters that the player can tweak, each round maybe getting some points to spend towards optimizing the turrets and weapons, but at the same time the 'enemies' could also have their GA working in their favor getting stronger each time to launch their offensive against your forts. Each game would be different, the replayability would be fantastic as no two rounds would ever be the same. Some games you could defend against many multiple small attackers well, but not well against fewer, large, slow firing attackers, and vice versa. You could have all types of weaponry, energy based, cold, fire, electricity, earth, sound, etc.. projectiles, etc... You can do all of this online, in flash (including the 3D engine), have you seen the Doom port in flash using alchemy? Perhaps you can use some of that code from the 3D engine source code so you don't have to re-invent the wheel (pun intended).
